# SOAFEE_monitor
Vehicle Monitoring System

Overview
This document describes a Python script designed for a basic vehicle monitoring system. The script focuses on tracking the vehicle's speed and fuel level, providing warnings when specific conditions are met. It's a simple demonstration, ideal for understanding basic principles, and is not a comprehensive solution for complex environments like SOAFEE (Service-Oriented Architecture for the Embedded Edge).

Features
Fuel Level Monitoring: The script alerts the user when the fuel level falls below a predefined threshold.
Speed Monitoring: It also monitors the vehicle's speed and issues warnings if the vehicle is either exceeding a set speed limit or moving too slowly.
Requirements
The script requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries or installations are necessary as it relies solely on the Python Standard Library.

Installation
There's no specific installation process needed for the script. Users can run it directly in any standard Python environment.

Usage
Instructions for running the script include downloading the script file, navigating to its directory via a terminal or command prompt, and executing it with Python. The steps are outlined in a simple, easy-to-follow manner.

Customization
The README suggests that users can adjust certain parameters like the thresholds for low fuel level and speed limits according to their preferences or requirements. It guides on which part of the script to modify for these changes.

License
The README notes that the project is open source, available under the MIT License, thus allowing for free use, modification, and distribution.
